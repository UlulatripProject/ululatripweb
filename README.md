# React Ululatrip Website Project

This project is based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/UlulatripProject/ululatripweb.git
cd ululatripweb
npm i
```

### Development

```
npm start
```

### Build

```
npm run build
```

## How it was made?
- It uses [babel-plugin-tailwind-components](https://github.com/bradlc/babel-plugin-tailwind-components)
- Add globals to eslint. So we can use `tw` globally.
- tailwind configuration is located in `src/tailwind.js`. Because `create-react-app` doesn't support importing file from outside `src`
